# Advanced-Audio-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Machine-Learning
This project classifies audio samples into 13 categories using deep learning (ANN, CNN1D, CNN2D) and machine learning models (GaussianNB, k-NN, SVM). It features MFCCs, Mel-Spectrogram, Chroma, and Tonnetz extraction, with models trained and evaluated for accuracy and efficiency.
